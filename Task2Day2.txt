Window Object:

The Window object is a global object in client-side JavaScript, representing the browser window containing a DOM document 
and acting as the root of the document object model.The window object, supported by all browsers, represents the browser’s 
window and automatically includes global JavaScript objects, functions, and variables as members.


The Window object is responsible for managing global variables, functions, and objects, providing methods for browser interaction
and managing properties related to frames, tabs, or windows, such as alert(), confirm(), setTimeout(), and setInterval().



Document Object:

The Document object is the HTML document that appears in the browser window and serves as an interface for interacting with the 
web page’s content. The browser generates a Document Object Model of a web page upon loading it.The W3C Document Object Model (DOM)
is a platform-neutral interface that enables dynamic access and updating of a document’s content, structure, and style by programs and scripts.

The DOM is a logical tree in a document, with methods allowing programmatic access to change its structure, style, or content.

The DOM manipulation tool offers methods to access and manipulate the structure and content of a document, such as getElementById(),
querySelector(), createElement(), and innerHTML. It represents the entire HTML document as a node tree, with the Document object as 
the root node. It allows dynamic updates and interactions with web page content.
